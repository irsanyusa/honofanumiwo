After all, I have been following American poetry for years, and should know just a little of what I am talking about. In the first place, to single out any one poet to whom to apply the title “Poetaster,” is letting prejudice override fairness entirely. In the second place, to apply that term to such a poet as Joseph Auslander is the height of the ridiculous. . . . The great majority of us are minor poets, but “poetaster,” by definition, implies the accusation of “paltry,” which, in its turn, is a sneer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I happen to admire Mr. Auslander’s work very much indeed. On that point opinions may differ, as they differ in regard to every writer. But certainly his work is head and shoulders above the rank and file of those writing verse in this country. Moreover, he has preserved both honesty of intention and vigorous independence as a craftsman. Yet to your many readers he is presented almost in the role of a charlatan. . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mr. Auslander’s chief claim to “newspaper fame,” may be that his wife has just won the Pulitzer Prize. That is, however, not by a league his chief claim to fame in the minds of those who have followed American poetry for years and have its best interests at heart. His chief claim to fame lies in his own work—and I say this as one who has just written a short prefatory note to the new edition of Miss Wurdemann’s Bright Ambush. . . . Such as that Mr. Auslander is “a lyric, not to say a complaining, poet” is to me an entirely uncalled-for, not to say an utterly unmeaning line. I could cite complaint, as your critic understands the term—or appears to understand it—in every fine poet since and including Shakespeare. Any adverse comment on existence might be so cited as a “complaint.” The “complaint” in Dante and in Milton must indeed be enormous! The whole thing is laughable, if it were not so unjust. . . . And why all this stuff about the Pulitzer Prize? It seems very petty in the face of Mr. Auslander’s own indifference. Plenty of poets have been writing for years, and writing well. Mr. Robinson Jeffers has been writing for years and writing well, and no Committee has ever given him the Pulitzer Prize. Do you suppose he cares?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The whole thing is to me distinctly shocking. You have a large circulation among plenty of people who only know of poetry what you tell them, and you have taken occasion to single out a particularly good poet for a casual, callous and uncritical pillorying. I happen to think that poetry is a higher form of writing than any other, and I honor any honest and able practitioner in the field.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">WILLIAM ROSE BENÉT</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Contributing Editor The Saturday Review of Literature New York City</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Congratulations to Editor Benét for his spirited defense of a brother-poet.—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Passenger’s Report</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I read your account of Pacific Greyhound’s opening their “Nitecoach” service between this city and Kansas City with great interest because I have just completed a round trip on these buses (TIME, May 6). However, you are not entirely correct in every detail.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the first place, the running time (which is so fast that it is hard to keep—we were late most of the way along the route, at one time as much as two hours and ten minutes which was later mostly made up) is not 52 hours but 51½. Secondly, their fare is not $24, but $29.50 plus $5 berth charge. Other minor points: there is no table in the compartments: there is no “hot”‘ water; the radio went out of commission within an hour of our start in our compartment but it wasn’t any good any way because of static due to the bus generator. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Schedules and equipment and operating personnel have not yet gotten down to a satisfactory state. . . . Our Western trip was canceled a few hours before departure because of motor trouble on the eastbound bus. “somewhere in Kansas.” Had a passenger written your story he probably would have added that: the speed maintained to keep on time exceeds many trains, for we traveled over 60 m.p.h. for hours at a stretch . . . the motors are rather noisy in gear; on a smooth highway such as Kansas offers, travel even at high speed is considerably steadier than any extra-fare Pullman ever built; the natives of much of the route regard the bus as a creation of Mars, judging by the way they stare at the apparition as it roars along the boulevards or chugs through small-town streets; passengers have to trust to luck to find congenial traveling companions, inasmuch as they are put together in groups of five or less in a compartment which, on the inside, is arranged much after the fashion of European trains.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the imperfections which are obviously due to the early stages of the business, these “sleeper buses” are far more comfortable both day and night than the conventional “parlor car bus,” or the day coach of the railroads; are cheaper than even “tourist sleepers;” offer the great middle class of travelers a novel, adventuresome medium for the long journey from the coast to the Middle West; will no doubt be in the near future greatly improved and extensively used.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DON SQUIRES</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Los Angeles, Calif.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reader Squires errs in his second major point. As TIME reported, the Los Angeles-Kansas City fare is $24 plus $5 for a berth. The rate is not to be confused with the Los Angeles-Chicago fare of $29.50 plus berth.—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Younger President</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In speaking of President-elect H.

D. Weeks, who was recently (May 2, 1935) appointed by the State Regents of Education to the presidency of the University of South Dakota. President-elect Weeks was born on Sept. 5, 1901, and hence is at present 33. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President-elect Weeks, former State Superintendent of Public Instruction, was chosen following the resignation of Dr. Herman G.

Your article relative to the Dominican Republic in the issue of May 13 carries the sting of personalities which casts a doubt as to the knowledge and sincerity of the author. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President Trujillo is an experienced statesman and politician as evidenced by his election to a second term. He is therefore accustomed and immune to criticism of his official life. But the slurring reference to his ”dubious beginnings,” “beige color” and “bastard child” must carry the barbs of insult and embarrassment straight to the hearts of his mother, wife and children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This writer is a native-born and white citizen of the U. S. and sincerely appreciates the honor of President Trujillo’s acquaintance and friendship. I therefore feel obligated to him, his mother, his beautiful and accomplished wife and daughters, his little boy and his six brothers, to assure my fellow Americans that Señor Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and his brothers are obviously of pure Castilian blood and are instantly recognized as gentlemen of education, culture and refinement. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ARTHUR R.

Having visited Santo Domingo in January and February of this year, I have had some experience with the strict censorship enforced there. . . . Judging from the contacts I had and from the general talk I should say your article was quite accurate concerning Trujillo and his super-dictatorship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Further instances of his power I noted were: prominent private citizens in the employ of American concerns in S. D. are obliged to entertain at least twice annually for Trujillo, his bodyguards, his Cabinet, all their bodyguards, and a goodly portion of his over-sized army, and on supercharged peace visits of the Haitian President and his entourage with cocktail parties costing from $700 to $1,600—the host’s house and grounds patrolled by Trujillo’s machine-gunners. Since the General Electric Co. has so far escaped Trujillo’s control, he is now employing prominent Dominican “ladies” as spies in his efforts to obtain the monopoly of the only paying American concern, and the one that has benefited the natives more than any other.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">J.

It was shown that there has been a perpetual permanent ratio between agricultural income and wages paid by industry—both being constantly about equal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hence, with foreign markets largely evaporated for U. S. agricultural products, with a normal surplus annually produced, it is necessary to find a new domestic market for that surplus. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Slash pine for paper, Tung oil for varnishes, soy beans for oils and plastics were all mentioned; but the big new proposed market—which might pull us out of the Depression, as did the automobile in 1920—21—is power alcohol.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One billion, six hundred million gallons of 199 proof anhydrous alcohol would be needed to make a 10% blend with the approximate 16,000,000,000 annual U. S. gasoline consumption. That this would relieve the problem of the agricultural surplus is indicated by the fact that to make it would consume all of the wheat raised in the U. S.; or on the other hand all of the oats, barley, rye and white potatoes; or on the other hand from one-third to one-half of the corn.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The House of Gurney, of Yankton, operating 500 filling stations over five western States, has pioneered with a. 2 ½% alcohol, 97 % gasoline blend, selling at the same price as the ordinary gas. . . . I have used it entirely since February, without any carburetor adjustments. It gives a sweet running motor. The alcohol has splendid antiknock properties. By keeping the engine carbon free it permits the use of third run gasoline, hence giving greater mileage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The South Dakota legislature, lately adjourned, enacted a law permitting the blend to be sold in the State as legal gas; the Nebraska legislature has relieved the alcohol content of a blend from payment of the State gasoline tax. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HARRY A.

A joint impartial study of the project, proposed through me by the American Petroleum Institute, if accepted by the Chemical Foundation, will reveal the fallacy of the project on the basis of present conditions and costs and the hopelessness of future manufacture of alcohol at prices of 7¢ per gallon, such as are predicted by enthusiastic protagonists of the scheme. Note that Mr. Henry Ford made no commitment on this scheme, that the prominent representatives of the automobile industry who were officially announced as speakers actually neither spoke nor attended and that Mr. Irénée du Pont described alcohol blending with gasoline as an economic waste.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">G.
