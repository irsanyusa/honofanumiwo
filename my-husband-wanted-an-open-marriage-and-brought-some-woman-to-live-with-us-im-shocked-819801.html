While it’s not still a&nbsp;mainstream now, there’s a&nbsp;big interest in&nbsp;being open.</p><p>Our today’s heroine has experienced another side of&nbsp;open marriage, and now the woman regrets making this choice. She wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter where she shared her story, and she asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish it&nbsp;in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get some opinions and advice from our readers. Here’s her complicated story with a&nbsp;very unexpected ending.</p><p><h2>Eva has always been satisfied with her traditional marriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c54/29b/1c595b53ed845bdc432e2ee780.jpg><p>Eva, 35, is&nbsp;our reader who decided to&nbsp;pen&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and share her dramatic family story. The woman seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;having mixed feelings about the whole situation, and she confessed that she’s still not sure about the decision that she made after her marriage started resembling a&nbsp;wild circus. Eva wanted our readers to&nbsp;share their honest opinions about her family conflict.</p><p>Eva opened her letter, saying, “Hi, <strong>Bright Side</strong>! I’ve faced a&nbsp;very bizarre situation in&nbsp;my&nbsp;seemingly solid and happy marriage. My&nbsp;husband Frank and&nbsp;I have been happily married for over 10&nbsp;years. I’ve always believed that we&nbsp;had this harmony, trust and commitment that any happy family does.<br>I’ve never even thought of&nbsp;having any sort of&nbsp;side relationships that would harm my&nbsp;marriage and would be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;infidelity. Frank has always been very family-oriented, he&nbsp;has never given me&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny reason for suspecting that his feelings for me&nbsp;are not true or&nbsp;that he’d prefer to&nbsp;have another woman in&nbsp;his life.”</p><p><h2>Eva’s husband has suddenly become interested in&nbsp;an&nbsp;open relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b0/960/f796a553fdabba3a940a64aa18.jpg><p>Eva continues her story, saying, “After the birth of&nbsp;our second child, I&nbsp;started putting on&nbsp;weight due to&nbsp;some hormonal disorder. Frank saw that&nbsp;I was insecure about my&nbsp;changing appearance and was doing his best to&nbsp;reassure me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I was looking gorgeous with my&nbsp;curves.<br>I&nbsp;finally came to&nbsp;terms with having gained some extra pounds, when Frank dropped a&nbsp;bombshell one evening, hinting that he’d prefer to&nbsp;have some more diversity in&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;loved me&nbsp;with all his heart, but he&nbsp;was feeling the necessity to&nbsp;have some ‘additional partner’, who’d have a&nbsp;different appearance from mine.”</p><p>“This was a&nbsp;hint that my&nbsp;beloved husband would love to&nbsp;try some side relationship, preferably with a&nbsp;skinny woman, and this is&nbsp;why he&nbsp;considered establishing an&nbsp;open relationship in&nbsp;our family.<br>Initially, for me&nbsp;this was a&nbsp;huge shock, because&nbsp;I have never thought of&nbsp;something like this before and&nbsp;I didn’t need to&nbsp;have other partners in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life except for my&nbsp;husband. Moreover, his hint that he’d like to&nbsp;try a&nbsp;relationship with a&nbsp;skinny woman sounded like a&nbsp;mockery and&nbsp;I felt it&nbsp;was quite a&nbsp;toxic statement, but&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;go.”</p><p><h2>Frank and Eva began to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;an&nbsp;open marriage, which brought a&nbsp;huge scandal to&nbsp;the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cce/dae/98f9cd548f98624bf2fe6cad95.jpg><p>Eva wrote, “One day, Frank decided not to&nbsp;beat about the bush anymore and said that we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;try an&nbsp;open marriage. I&nbsp;had so&nbsp;many doubts about this idea, but after a&nbsp;very honest conversation, I&nbsp;finally gave up&nbsp;and agreed reluctantly.<br>Frank immediately started dating other women, while&nbsp;I wasn’t actually in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;any partners for myself. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;indifferent about the situation as&nbsp;I could and make myself busy with other things and hobbies.”</p><p>“One day, Frank shocked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the core, because he&nbsp;brought one of&nbsp;his side partners to&nbsp;our house, introduced her to&nbsp;me&nbsp;as&nbsp;Alyson, and announced that this woman will live with&nbsp;us for 3–4&nbsp;months, because she had some issues with her landlord and needed a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;until she would find a&nbsp;decent apartment that would satisfy all her needs.<br>To&nbsp;say that&nbsp;I was dumbfounded is&nbsp;to&nbsp;say nothing. At&nbsp;that very moment, I&nbsp;already knew that&nbsp;I would divorce my&nbsp;husband, because he&nbsp;went too far in&nbsp;his willingness to&nbsp;be&nbsp;free from any commitments. But I&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;scandal, and plotted a&nbsp;revenge instead.”</p><p><h2>Eva taught her husband a&nbsp;lesson he&nbsp;will probably never forget.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d6/653/74e18156a58430730fee039d87.jpg><p>Eva wrote, “As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;Alyson, the new partner of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband, made herself at&nbsp;home, this bold woman started to&nbsp;behave like she was the wife, and&nbsp;I was just a&nbsp;random person. I&nbsp;was doing all housework, and she was just relaxing and enjoying the company of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband.<br>One day, I&nbsp;stopped doing all things around the house. I&nbsp;washed only my&nbsp;and our kid’s dishes, cleaned only after myself and the kid, and cooked only for myself and the kid. Frank didn’t like this behavior, he&nbsp;noticed that&nbsp;I stopped even packing his lunches for him before he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;work.<br>I&nbsp;completely ditched all my&nbsp;domestic responsibilities as&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife and started acting like&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;guest in&nbsp;the house. One day, Frank said that we&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;talk, and&nbsp;I was waiting for him to&nbsp;initiate the conversation, because&nbsp;I had something to&nbsp;say. I&nbsp;insisted that we&nbsp;must talk in&nbsp;the presence of&nbsp;Alyson, since she was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our family now, Frank was surprised about this suggestion, but he&nbsp;agreed.”</p><p>“Then, we&nbsp;sat down for a&nbsp;talk, three of&nbsp;us, and Frank awkwardly mentioned that he&nbsp;was puzzled and frustrated about my&nbsp;behavior. He&nbsp;said that having an&nbsp;open marriage was our mutual decision, and he&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I liked the idea. He&nbsp;complained that&nbsp;I was acting like a&nbsp;stranger towards him, and this made him depressed and annoyed. I&nbsp;listened carefully to&nbsp;all his complaints, and then it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;speak.<br>I&nbsp;spoke with a&nbsp;calm voice that&nbsp;I rehearsed so&nbsp;many times while being prepared for this nasty conversation. I&nbsp;said, ’My dear husband, I&nbsp;must say that I&nbsp;am also disappointed about having this open marriage. You thought that&nbsp;I liked the idea, but&nbsp;I hated it&nbsp;with all my&nbsp;heart from the very beginning. The only reason&nbsp;I agreed to&nbsp;it&nbsp;was your comfort, which i&nbsp;now deeply regret. Now that you totally ignored my&nbsp;needs and my&nbsp;feelings, I’m not your wife anymore, because you have another wife now, who lives in&nbsp;your house and must do&nbsp;all <a href=# title=chores data-link=tag>chores</a> for you.<br>She must share household routines with you, take care of&nbsp;you and cook your lunches. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your family now, not mine, because&nbsp;I never wanted such a&nbsp;family. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;ask Alyson now if&nbsp;she’s happy knowing that she’ll be&nbsp;doing your laundry now, cleaning your bedroom and that she’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who’ll solve all your daily problems together with you.’”</p><p>Eva wrote, “Alyson and Frank looked very disturbed because of&nbsp;what I&nbsp;said. None of&nbsp;them expected this. Alyson stood up&nbsp;and left the room with a&nbsp;dramatic expression on&nbsp;her face. Frank started apologizing. But I&nbsp;didn’t care anymore.<br>I&nbsp;took my&nbsp;things and moved out, and now I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;divorce. Do&nbsp;you think I’m on&nbsp;a&nbsp;right way, or&nbsp;should&nbsp;I give my&nbsp;husband another chance?”</p><p>And here's a dramatic story of a woman, who experienced a nasty payback for her big heart and sincere hospitality. The woman agreed to let her husband's female friend to live in their house, and regretted this immediately after she moved in with them. <a href=#>Read more</a> to find out how our heroine dealt with this family crisis and why she regrets her extreme kindness now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6uK3NrZydZZGjerC8xKdkppmip7ais8RmmKecXZe%2FsMHGoatmq5%2Bism7DzqaYp2WkpHqttdWeZLChpJ16tr%2BMoqRmq5iksKyxw2ZvanFoZX5wi9KhprCXkaG5oK%2FOpqSepqSo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./preservation-de-leau-plus-que-jamais-le-moment-dinvestir.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="plus que jamais le moment d'investir">&larr;
