Only Spain now stand between them and their first major victory since 1966.</p><p data-block-key=1qb3l>Getting to the final hasn't been easy, nor is it what the public expected. In June, before the tournament started, just one in six (18%) Britons expected England to get to the final, with most predicting they would get knocked out in the quarter or semi finals (33% and 29% respectively). Even at the start of this week, having qualified for the semis, less than a third (29%) expected England to beat the Netherlands, with 43% still doubting their chances. Not even one in ten (9%) felt winning was a possibility.</p><p data-block-key=fv31v>Now, that has jumped – a wave of optimism pushing a quarter (26%) to believe England will win the Euros. Nonetheless, they are not the public’s favourites – nearly half of Britons expecting a Spanish victory in a repeat of last year’s women’s world cup final. Those very interested in football, though, have greater faith in the Three Lions, with 43% expecting an English victory, against 46% who fancy Spain’s chances more. Scots, however, a bit more sceptical of England’s chances, with just 6% expecting them to beat Spain.</p><p data-block-key=1g128>But regardless of what the eventual outcome is, this Euros has managed to engage the British public more than they anticipated. Before the tournament started, only a third (35%) of Britons said they were expecting to really follow it. But this number has steadily risen over the past month, with 45% now saying they have followed the tournament at least a fair amount and 55% saying they will watch the final.</p><p data-block-key=adpi7>That said, piquing public interest has not fully translated into believing an England triumph will be cause for a national celebration, with <a href=#>only four in ten (39%) supporting a shotgun bank holiday</a>. The country is also not convinced that it is necessary for prime minister Keir Starmer to watch the game – just one in four (25%) believing it is essential for senior politicians to watch a tournament final featuring a home nations team, with this being a decrease from 32% at the start of the Euros.</p><p data-block-key=41f6q><a href=#>Following Starmer’s lead</a>, the English football team’s favourability ratings have similarly improved as a result of a successful campaign, albeit having to recover from a massive hit taken after their poorly received early performance. England entered the competition with a net favourability score of +35, with this sinking to just +2 after the round of 16. Now, that figure has shot back up, with a net rating of +39 and nearly six in ten (57%) holding a favourable view of the team as a whole.</p><p data-block-key=pjva>Manager Gareth Southgate, who had previously taken a clear hit in popularity, has largely seen a recovery in his ratings, with 53% now having a favourable view of him and just one in five (19%) an unfavourable one. Having fallen to just +7, Southgate’s net score currently stands at +34, a little down on the +41 he held a month ago. No doubt many England fans will be willing to fully memory-hole their earlier doubts around his leadership if he does succeed in bringing football home. However, the public are less sure of whether he deserves to be <i>Sir</i> Gareth Southgate, <a href=#>only a third (33%) believing he should receive a knighthood</a> for getting to the final.</p><p data-block-key=7pdtl>Where positivity has not really returned has been with captain Harry Kane. He went into the tournament with a higher net favourability rating (+38) than the team (+35), but despite his equalising penalty keeping England in the game against the Netherlands, his ratings have not shot back up like the team as a whole. Half of Brits (49%) still have a positive view of him, but the number seeing him in an unfavourable light has risen from one in eight (12%) to one in five (21%).</p><p data-block-key=e2t6j><b>See the full results </b><a href=#><b>here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=ai4go>What do you think about the England football team, sport in general, and everything else?
