We’ve rounded up the best online retailers selling bridesmaid dresses, from fashionable designer frocks to simple, airy shifts just made for a beachy bridal party.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-places-to-buy-bridesmaids-dresses-online>Our top picks for the best places to buy bridesmaids dresses online</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Anthropologie</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/5de70he6op10/53ZOE4rRqrxcvv0hg2eSLV/a849085e5f600c618132be2475017746/anthro-logo.svg alt=Anthropologie title=Anthropologie width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Anthropologie</h3></p><p>There’s something for every kind of nuptial, from a beachy casual destination to a formal black tie during the holidays in Anthropologie’s bridal party collection. From elegant and eclectic slinky sheaths to fun and fairy tale-worthy tulle gowns, these bridesmaid dresses are guaranteed to make an impression at the altar and the afterparty. And because Anthropologie knows how to curate flattering gowns, your bridesmaids will wear them again. Shopping tip: Anthropologie also made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy a wedding dress online</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: Varies on the dress; a majority are 00-26, and some plus sizes are available</li><li>Shipping: Free standard shipping for items over $50</li><li>Returns: 30-day online or in-store returns</li><li>Prices starting at: Varies on the dress, some as low as $125. At the time of publication, there were eight dresses available under $200</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Curated shop</li><li>Diverse options</li><li>Designs stray from typical bridal attire</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some dresses are not size inclusive</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>J.Crew</a></h3><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.jcrew.com/next-static/images/sidecar-modules/navigation/jcrew-logo-fall-21.svg alt="J.Crew Collection Layered Slip Dress in Sheer Organza" title="J.Crew Collection Layered Slip Dress in Sheer Organza" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>J.Crew Collection Layered Slip Dress in Sheer Organza</h3></p><p>J.Crew doesn’t sell wedding gowns anymore, but it still carries a chic line of dresses suitable for bridesmaids and other wedding party members. The J.Crew Wedding Shop offers a range of elegant floor-length slip dresses, designed with everything from sequins to floral crepe. Its mini-slip dress in layered organza or cotton poplin is charming and simple, but stylish enough for the ceremony.</p><p>Note, these are suggestions by the brand to use as bridal party attire, but J.Crew’s affordable designs won’t disappoint the bride or her bridesmaids. (Or even the groom and his groomsmen—J.Crew made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best men’s clothing brands</a>.)</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 00-24; 3X</li><li>Shipping: 3 to 6 business days (standard)</li><li>Returns: Free returns for up to 30 days in-store or online</li><li>Prices starting at: $98</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Classic lines</li><li>Wide range of designs and colors for slip dresses</li><li>Matching shoes and purses available for purchase</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Many designs are slip dresses that don’t flatter every figure</li><li>Would be nice to have more choices</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Nordstrom</a></h3><p>If you want a brick-and-mortar option in your back pocket while you shop online for bridesmaid dresses, it’s worth ducking (virtually or</p><p>physically) into a Nordstrom store. There, you will find beautiful gowns and frocks (from designers like Badgley Mischka and Shona Joy) galore to fit all your bridesmaids. Seasonal, stylish looks abound at Nordstrom, and because of its large inventory (over 200 bridesmaid dresses), it is easy to check out a few styles and compare them. Bonus: If you live near one of 300-plus Nordstrom stores, they offer to tailor when you purchase your bridal attire online or in person. It’s also no surprise Nordstrom made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy dresses online</a> and <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy shoes online</a> (check out their formal shoe selection particularly, especially for finding the <a rel=alternate href=#>best wedding shoes</a>).</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 00-24, in some designs 28 and 4+</li><li>Shipping: Free standard shipping</li><li>Returns: Free returns in-store or online</li><li>Prices starting at: $50</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Wide selection and price points</li><li>Free shipping and returns</li><li>Free tailoring</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>The range of gowns for larger sizes is small</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Revolve</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Symone Dress by Amanda Uprichard</h3></p><p>Revolve sells fashionable frocks by name-brand designers, like Shona Joy and Alice + Olivia for your bridesmaids. These bridesmaid gowns are stylish and sophisticated, and you can search for dresses based on venues like black tie or beach weddings to find the perfect style for the big day. The best part? This retailer also offers free two-day shipping, so if you’re in a rush, Revolve can solve your time crunch.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: XXS-4X</li><li>Shipping: Free two-day</li><li>Returns: Free before 60 days</li><li>Prices starting at: $94</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Free two-day shipping</li><li>Range of sizes</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Many dresses come with high price tags</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Unique Vintage</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Unique Vintage</h3></p><p>Glamorous vintage-inspired gowns designed in Los Angeles from Unique Vintage are a great option for making a fashion statement. At Unique Vintage (one of the best size-inclusive online shops for dresses, in our opinion), your wedding party can channel retro and vintage vibes in dresses of varying lengths and styles. Slinky gowns and frou-frou mini frocks can all be found at this Burbank, California-based boutique either in-person or online. Selections start at approximately $72 and go up from there. Don’t forget to browse their accessories section.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: XS to 5X (depending on the dress)</li><li>Shipping: Free shipping—8 to 14 business days</li><li>Returns: 30 days from the delivery date of your order (does not pertain to final sale items)</li><li>Prices starting at: $72</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Size inclusive</li><li>Range of dress styles</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It may take up to two weeks for free shipping</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Rent the Runway</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>AMSALE Blush Strapless Gown</h3></p><p>Sometimes, you just don’t need another bridesmaid dress hanging in your closet, and if so, Rent the Runway can help. Choose from over 480 curated bridesmaid dresses from designers and brands like Reformation, ALC, and Monique Lhuillier. Rent it, wear it, and return it after the wedding because if you’re a member, you can keep the dress until you want to return it. If you don’t have or want an RTR membership, you only have up to eight days to wear the dress, so plan accordingly.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 0-22</li><li>Shipping: Free standard shipping for members; $9.95 for one-time rentals</li><li>Returns: N/A</li><li>Prices starting at: Various depending on memberships/one-time rentals and designs</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>The option to return the dress after the wedding</li><li>Affordable rentals on designer gowns and dresses</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>To take full advantage of time frames for returns, you must be a member</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Lulus</a></h3><p>Slinky and stylish wedding party dresses from Lulus can ensure your bridesmaids don’t break their budgets. These affordable designs are mainly floor-length (at the time of publication, we only found four midi options and no mini dresses) in a range of colors and fabrics. Many of the dresses have modern cut-outs, slits, and plunging necklines, so if you are looking for a demure design, you may have to scroll through to find a good fit. Otherwise, these affordable options in many styles can help your bridesmaids not overspend on their outfits.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: XXS to 3X (depending on the dress)</li><li>Shipping: Free standard shipping over $50</li><li>Returns: 30 days</li><li>Prices starting at: $69</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Somewhat size inclusive</li><li>30-day return policy</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>No mini and few midi dress options</li></ul><h3>Bella Bridesmaids</h3><p>Bella specializes in wedding-party attire and offers a dazzling array of ready-to-wear and designer creations from Amsale and Jenny Yoo, among others. Because Bella specializes in weddings, bridesmaids will find a wide selection of dresses in almost any combination of colors, styles, necklines, and fabrics on the website. They also carry bridesmaid maternity dresses, chic jumpsuits (not all bridesmaids wear gowns), and more.</p><p>Bella dresses are made to specifications, and different makers have different lead times. It can take up to six months to get your dress, so the store advises you to contact them before you buy so that you can find out the lead time for a particular designer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 000 to 5X</li><li>Shipping: Depends on the dress</li><li>Returns: N/A</li><li>Prices starting at: Approximately $180</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Many dress options</li><li>Traditional wedding attire retailer so understands bridal clothes</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Could take six months to receive your dress</li></ul><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Petal & Pup</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Mickenna Sweetheart Frill Midi Dress - Emerald</h3></p><p>These bridesmaid dresses don’t disappoint, thanks to their chic and varied designs.

We considered the variety of dress styles, colors, sizes, designers, prices, and shipping times, and return policies to make our list. We spoke to our friends and colleagues about which bridesmaid dresses they loved (or hated) and where they bought them. We also read (and re-read) customer reviews and ratings to bolster our choices for the best place to buy bridesmaid dresses online.</p><h2 id=what-to-keep-in-mind-when-buying-a-bridesmaid-dress-online>What to keep in mind when buying a bridesmaid dress online</h2><p>When buying bridesmaid dresses online, consider a few factors because nothing is worse than being forced to wear an uncomfortable dress for hours and hours. If you’re lucky, the bride will have jumped on the trend of having the bridesmaids choose their own dress.</p><p>Here are some tips on what to look for when buying bridesmaid dresses online:</p><h3>Style</h3><p>These days, you don’t have to keep your bridesmaids in the same dress—break with tradition and allow them to choose what they wear. Mismatched or mix-and-match bridesmaid outfits are trending. Let them wear what they want. If you need a bit of fashion cohesion in your wedding party’s attire, you could give them a color or palette.</p><h3>Measurements</h3><p>Take careful measurements (bust, hip, and waist, plus sleeves and hollow to hem, i.e., collarbone to where you want the hem to finish) before you buy a dress to find the right size. If your dress is being made to order, you must send your measurements to the designer.</p><h3>Timeline</h3><p>It’s extremely stress-inducing (both for you and the bride) to find out your dress will arrive after the wedding. Consider how much time you need to secure your gown and tailor it to fit. Note many made-to-order dresses can take months to create and ship.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>When should I order my bridal dress?</h3><p>Give yourself at least six months if you’re planning to wear a made-to-order dress.</p><h3>How will I know to order the right size for me?</h3><p>Like most clothing for special occasions, it’s worth ordering a few sizes to find your best fit, even after you take your measurements. Formalwear can usually benefit from tailoring as well.</p><h3>What is the average price to spend on a bridesmaid dress?</h3><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Zola</a>, an online wedding registry, the average bridesmaid dress is around $150, but that doesn’t include the cost of alterations or the shoes and accessories that may have to go with it. (Sidenote: Zola is also a great place to start your registry, and made our list of the best places to buy <a rel=alternate href=#>wedding photo albums</a>.)</p><h3>Who is supposed to buy the bridesmaid dresses?</h3><p>Traditionally, the bridesmaids are responsible for buying their dresses. We suggest brides consider allowing their wedding party to have some say on what they’ll spend their money on. Buying a high-quality, well-made dress you love and want to wear again may make it worth the splurge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loKGupLHSZquoZZKqxm6u0aKbnqudlralv4ydqZ6ro5rAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./january.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Historical Events in January 2007">&larr;
