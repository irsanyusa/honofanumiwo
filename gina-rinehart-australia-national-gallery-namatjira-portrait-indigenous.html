But her reported attempts to get the unflattering portrait taken down is backfiring: the piece, part of a collection of portraits by an acclaimed indigenous artist, has been defended by the museum, the arts industry, and—perhaps worst for her—social media users, who have given it more attention than ever.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The portrait features Rinehart, who is 70 years old, with a misshapen head, downturned lips, and a double chin. It is part of an exhibition titled “<a href=#>Vincent Namatjira: Australia in colour</a>,” which opened at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in Canberra in March and is set to run until July 21.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The exhibition of portraits by Namatjira, a 40-year-old Aboriginal Australian who has won the prestigious Archibald Prize for portraiture, also contains depictions of other famous people—including Queen Elizabeth II, former Australian rules football player Adam Goodes, and former Prime Ministers Julia Gillard and Scott Morrison—all in Namatjira’s <a href=#>signature style</a> that often employs humor and exaggerated features to interrogate the rich and powerful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EX-WR-LVN24-21-21-VN_NGA_Vincents-Vision_1_Adobe-RGB-4000px-1-Large-Viewing-JPEG-4200px.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I paint the world as I see it,” Namatjira said, in response to Reinhart’s reported attempts to have her portrait taken down, in a statement shared with TIME by the NGA on Thursday. “People don’t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, ‘why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?’”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I paint people who are wealthy, powerful, or significant—people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Namatjira, who <a href=#>explained</a> his intention behind the exhibition at a panel discussion organized by the NGA in March, the portraits are meant to convey that “we are all equal in Australia, no matter where you’re from, no matter what you do or what background you’re from, or what heritage you’re from, we’re all Australian.” He added that the choice of wall colors—red, black, and yellow—represents <a href=#>the Aboriginal flag</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Vincent-Namatjira-in-Vincent-Namatjira_-Australia-in-colour-web-version.webp?w=384&quality=75"><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is not the first time Rinehart has featured in Namatjira’s paintings. In his 2017 paintings <a href=#>Gina Rinehart and Me</a> and <a href=#>Gina Rinehart and Me II</a>, she’s portrayed standing beside the artist himself; she was also painted as a <a href=#>standalone portrait</a> in his 2017 series “The Richest.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rinehart, who took over mineral extraction company Hancock Prospecting from her father and whose net worth is estimated at <a href=#>over $30 billion</a>, is known for her financial support of the country’s sporting scene. She’s also <a href=#>listed</a> on the NGA’s website as a “friend” of the gallery for donating between A$4,999 (over $3,000) and A$9,999 (under $7,000) in the most recent fiscal quarter.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rinehart directly contacted NGA council director Nick Mitzevich and chair Ryan Stokes to ask for the removal of her portrait, and associates of her company have lodged more than a dozen complaints to the gallery, the <a href=#>Sydney Morning Herald</a> reported on Wednesday. A group of 20 Australian swimmers—a sport for which she’s known to provide vital funding—have also campaigned against her portrait on display, calling it <a href=#>“offensive to a great Australian.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rinehart, contacted through Hancock Prospecting, did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The gallery is not backing down, saying in a statement on Wednesday that it “welcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Since 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollack’s Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the gallery,” the NGA said. “We present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The National Association for the Visual Arts also published a statement backing the right for artists to “create art about any subject and by any means.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“While Rinehart has the right to express her opinions about the work,” the association’s executive director Penelope Benton <a href=#>said</a> on Thursday, “she does not have the authority to pressure the gallery into withdrawing the painting simply because she dislikes it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>An Australian Art Museum Is Installing a Toilet to Keep Its ‘Ladies Lounge’ Off Limits to Men</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rinehart has courted controversy before with Indigenous Australians. In 2022, Hancock Prospecting <a href=#>withdrew</a> A$15 million (about $10 million) in sponsorship funding from Netball Australia after the national team voiced its support for Donnell Wallam, an Indigenous netballer who had refused to wear a uniform with the mining company’s logo. Wallam cited concerns about <a href=#>racist comments</a> Rinehart’s late father had made against Aboriginal Australians, including that those who hadn’t “assimilated” should be sterilized—which Rinehart has long remained silent over, even as she faced growing <a href=#>public calls</a> to apologize.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, instead of shielding the unflattering depiction of herself from public view, Rinehart finds herself the victim of the so-called Streisand effect—the phenomenon whereby attempts to quash attention to something ironically only cause it to get amplified—as news of her dissatisfaction with the art exhibition has inspired international coverage, which has resurfaced her family’s unsavory history, as well as widespread <a href=#>memes</a> and <a href=#>mockery</a> on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdthHGFjqCgp5ldp7avsceaqa1lkarAtb7ApaCaZZ6Wwaq7zZqjZp%2BRobmmvthmpZqlkam3qr7AZqeoqqSnrqrAjKKlnaGXmruwwdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-bow-wow-make-latest-28-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Bow Wow Make?
