However, there’s a good reason to think about these casual pants, which have gotten a bit of a makeover in recent years. Today, there’s a whole crop of stylish (and in some cases, indeed, cropped) chinos out there. Alongside a panel of style experts, we’ve compiled our picks for the best chinos for men, whatever the occasion, budget, or body type.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-chinos-for-men>Our picks for the best chinos for men</h2><h3>Best budget chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>ASOS Classic Rigid Lightweight Chinos</a></h3><p>“When looking for stylish, yet budget-conscious chinos, brands such as ASOS provide fantastic budget offerings, allowing you to stay trendy without breaking the bank,” says celebrity business strategist, stylist, and creator <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nina Vargas</a>. Our preferred option is this pair of classic olive green pants that can be dressed up or down as appropriate.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: W26, L30-W38, L34</li><li>Cut: Regular rise, tapered fit</li><li>Fabric: 97% cotton, 3% spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $36</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Classic fit</li><li>Inexpensive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only one color in this style, but they have multiple other styles and fits in different colors</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best budget chinos</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ASOS DESIGN classic rigid chinos in olive green</h3></p><h3>Best trendy men’s chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>AllSaints Walde Mid-Rise Skinny Chino Pants</a></h3><p>With the right cut, chinos can look every bit as modern as the rest of your wardrobe. “For fashion-forward options in men's chinos, explore brands like AllSaints,” says Vargas. “These styles provide modern cuts featuring unique details that make an eye-catching fashion statement, as well as contemporary designs to complete a trendy ensemble.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 28W-36W</li><li>Cut: Mid rise, regular leg</li><li>Fabric: 98% cotton, 2% elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $169</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Enough stretch to be comfortable</li><li>Stylish silhouette</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>All five color options are very subdued</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best trendy men’s chinos</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Walde Mid-Rise Skinny Chino Pants</h3></p><h3>Best stretch chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dockers Ultimate Chinos</a></h3><p>If you’re adding chinos to your closet for the first time, you might want to look for something with a little stretch, especially if you’re transitioning from wearing mostly sweatpants or joggers. “Look for stretch chinos from Dockers—their fabrics incorporate stretch fibers for ease of movement and added comfort throughout your day,” says Vargas. Their Ultimate line features Dockers’ Smart 360 Flex material and a flexible waistband, so even the staunchest of sweatpants lovers will feel at home.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 28W, 29L-40W, 36L</li><li>Cut: Slim</li><li>Fabric: 95% cotton, 5% elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $49.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Includes hidden security pocket with concealed zip</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews complain that sizing is inconsistent</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best stretch chinos</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Dockers Ultimate Chinos, Slim Fit, Men's, Grey 30 x 30</h3></p><h3>Best chinos for men with big thighs: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bonobos Stretch Washed Chino 2.0</a></h3><p>“Bonobos offers five different fits in their chinos, so there’s one that will work for everyone,” says fashion expert and retail executive <a rel=nofollow href=#>Todd Hanshaw</a>. For guys rockin’ thighs, we suggest choosing the Athletic fit. “Bonobos’ Athletic fit is an excellent choice for men with bigger thighs,” says Vargas. “These pants offer generous coverage while still maintaining tailored details to ensure a flattering, comfortable, and effortless fit.” Shopping tip: For an even better fit, consider what’s underneath. Our list of the<a rel=alternate href=#> best men’s underwear</a> has options for any concern.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 28W-46W</li><li>Cut: Athletic</li><li>Fabric: 92% cotton, 8% spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Five different fits</li><li>Wrinkle-resistant</li><li>Secure zip pocket</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews complain about inconsistent sizing</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best chinos for men with big thighs</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Stretch Washed Chino 2.0</h3></p><h3>Most comfortable men’s chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Polo Ralph Lauren Stretch Chino Pants</a></h3><p>“Ralph Lauren makes a great chino—it’s been a basic to his business since the beginning,” says Hanshaw. “They’re always comfortable and always great.” These chinos come in a wide selection of sizes and colors, as well as the option of slim or straight cut (we opted for slim for this listing), so provided you’re not looking for anything too bright or eye-catching, you can almost certainly find something here that works for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 28W, 29L-44W, 39L</li><li>Cut: Slim</li><li>Fabric: Cotton, elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $79.99 or $138, depending on color choice</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>13 color options</li><li>Soft</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Most of the color options are quite subdued</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Most comfortable men’s chinos</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Stretch Chino Pant – All Fits</h3></p><h3>Best lightweight chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Uniqlo Slim-Fit Chino Pants</a></h3><p>“Uniqlo specialize in lightweight chinos designed specifically to keep you cool in warmer conditions, featuring cotton or linen blend fabric for breathability and optimal cooling properties,” says Vargas. We’re going with Uniqlo’s Slim-Fit chinos, made from soft Supima cotton and featuring tapered legs with dress trouser-style side seams—smart enough to wear for a formal occasion, comfortable enough to feel good doing it. Shopping tip: Uniqlo is one of the most affordable shops to make our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best men’s clothing brands</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 27W-40W</li><li>Cut: Slim</li><li>Fabric: 97% cotton, 3% spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $49.90</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Soft</li><li>Good shape</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>All six color options are fairly basic</li></ul><h3>Best cropped chinos: <a rel=nofollow href=#>ASOS Skinny Cropped Chinos</a></h3><p>“ASOS offer cropped chinos that feature shorter inseam length, providing trendy yet modern style for casual or semi-formal events,” says Vargas. We particularly like their skinny offering—yes, skinny jeans are already a thing of the past, but paired with the cropped length, these chinos will still look great for a semi-smart summer occasion.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: W26, L30-W38, L34</li><li>Cut: Skinny</li><li>Fabric: 97% cotton, 3% spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $15</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Inexpensive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Currently only one color option</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best cropped chinos</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ASOS Skinny Cropped Chinos</h3></p><h3>Best chino shorts: <a rel=nofollow href=#>J.Crew Stretch Chino Shorts</a></h3><p>“Brands like J.Crew are known for crafting stylish, yet high quality chino shorts, ideal for summer casual outings,” says Vargas. “Look for options that hit above the knee while providing comfort—these could make the ideal summer shorts!” With that in mind, we’ve gone for the 5”-inch inseam version, because come on, it’s summer, show a little thigh, my dude!</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 28W-42W</li><li>Cut: Regular</li><li>Fabric: Cotton, elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $49.99-$69.50, depending on color choice</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Four length options</li><li>10 color choices</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews mention that sizes run large</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best chino shorts</span></p><p><h3 class=title>J.Crew Stretch Chino Shorts</h3></p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-chinos-for-men>How to choose the best chinos for men</h2><p>“When choosing a pair of chinos, consider the color, the occasion, your wardrobe, and the fit,” suggests Farnam Elyasof, CEO and founder at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Flex Suits</a>. “For starters, make sure you’ve <a rel=alternate href=#>measured your waist</a> size and the length of your legs correctly so you pick a pair that perfectly complements your physique. Correct measurements are how you'll avoid selecting a pair that's either too long, too loose, too tight, or too short—any of these will make you stand out for all the wrong reasons.”</p><p>“There are different types of chinos for different occasions, so the right choice will depend on whether it calls for dressing up or dressing down,” Elyasof continues. “For a more casual look, go for a pair that has pockets at the back and material that’s a bit thicker. If you're looking to dress up, your best choice will be a pair with pockets on the side and whose material feels thinner. Lastly, you'll need to factor in the rest of your wardrobe when choosing the right-colored pair of chinos. You want to go with a color that you can easily match with what's already in your closet—that way, you'll derive more utility from this men's fashion staple.”</p><p>Shopping tip: If you’re stocking up on chinos, you may want to take a moment to consider the state of your shoes. Our list of the best loafers for men include options that go casual or polished.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-chinos-for-men>How we selected the best chinos for men</h2><p>We made our selections through a combination of advice from style experts with experience in the men’s fashion industry, thorough research, personal experience, and searching for brands with majority positive customer reviews.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Which fit is best for chinos?</h3><p>“Choosing the appropriate fit of chinos depends on your body type and personal style,” says Vargas. “Slim-fit or tapered chinos from brands like Bonobos or J.Crew can provide a chic silhouette, or for a more relaxed, yet formal appearance, straight-leg chinos from Dockers or Gap may offer better coverage.”</p><p>“Chinos should generally be ankle-length, or slightly shorter for a pair you wouldn't mind wearing without socks,” says Elyasof. “The pair you choose should naturally fit your waist without needing the assistance of a belt, or being so tight that it makes movement uncomfortable. Similarly, the pair should fit snugly around your knees and hips and naturally follow the outline of your legs down to the bottom. There should be about an inch of space between the fabric and your hips, as well as between the material and your knees, for maximum comfort and unrestricted movement.”</p><h3>Are chinos for older men?</h3><p>“Chinos are for everyone!” says Hanshaw. “At one time they might have been the chosen casual pants for the more conservative or older crowd, but they’ve made their way to many of the runways of the men's designers. They haven't changed the base, but they have made some fit changes to give them more tailoring and an updated look that’s been embraced by younger and older alike. What is old is new again!”</p><p>“Chinos are timeless classics suitable for men of any age, providing a polished and sophisticated alternative to jeans that makes them essential components in any stylish wardrobe, regardless of its owner,” adds Vargas.</p><p>“Chinos are for men of all ages, and are one of the most versatile pants a man can have in his wardrobe,” agrees Elyasof. “The trick is to style these pants in a way that matches your tastes, fashion sense, and the occasion you're wearing them to.”</p><h3>Are chinos and khakis the same thing?</h3><p>“Chinos and khakis are not the same thing, despite the fact that the terms are often used interchangeably,” explains Elyasof. “Whereas chinos are made of lightweight cotton or cotton-blend materials, khakis tend to have a heavier construction. Khakis are also not designed to be as form-fitting as chinos, and are not particularly suitable for formal or semi-formal occasions.”</p><h3>What is the best material for chinos?</h3><p>“True chinos are only cotton,” says Hanshaw. “In fact, the cotton process of the fabric is called ‘chino’ and is a steep twill that is mercerized to a bit of a shine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk522r7vSZp2oql2isq97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-places-to-buy-bridesmaids-dresses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best Places To Buy Bridesmaid Dresses Online for Any Budget">&larr;
