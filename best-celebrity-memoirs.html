From silent film legend <a href=#>Charlie Chaplin</a> to Nickelodeon child star <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy</a>, Hollywood autobiographies have been a thing for generations now. But in the last few years, publishing has seen a <a href=#>celebrity memoir boom</a> in which chart-topping pop stars and <a href=#>Brat Packers</a> alike are more than willing to bare their souls for our amusement. To much success; last year, <a href=#>Prince Harry’s Spare</a> became the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time, according to <a href=#>Guinness World Records</a>, besting previous record holder <a href=#>Michelle Obama</a> and her 2018 memoir, Becoming.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With so many celebrity memoirs to choose from, TIME has put together a list of the best, which includes <a href=#>Elliot Page</a>’s coming out story, <a href=#>Stanley Tucci</a>’s food-focused walk down memory lane, and <a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a>’s hilarious account of what it’s really like being a <a href=#>nepo-baby</a> 50 years before the term went viral.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, “celebrity” isn’t just code for famous actors; this unranked list features celebrated performers from all walks of entertainment life. There are four <a href=#>EGOT winners</a>—<a href=#>Viola Davis</a>, <a href=#>Mel Brooks</a>, <a href=#>Rita Moreno</a> and <a href=#>Elton John</a>—included here. As well as books from a couple of renowned athletes, including <a href=#>Andre Agassi</a>’s much-talked about airing of tennis grievances and <a href=#>Megan Rapinoe</a>’s empowering call to action. Not to mention one First Lady and a few eloquent aging rockers.

Co-written with J.R. Moehringer, who also <a href=#>helped Prince Harry with Spare</a> as well as his own memoir, <a href=#>The Tender Bar</a>, Open covers the highs and lows of the career of the once-mulleted bad boy of tennis. Agassi calls out <a href=#>on-court rivals</a> and delves into his off-court troubles, which included crystal meth use. He even declares his one-time hatred for tennis, detailing his father’s abusive training tactics that caused him to loathe the sport, which makes the chapters dedicated to his <a href=#>joy-filled late career surge</a> all the more poignant.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Open on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">By Myself and Then Some, Lauren Bacall (2005)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/LaurenBacall.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1979, screen legend <a href=#>Lauren Bacall</a> released her National Book Award-winning memoir, By Myself, which offered an intimate look at her life, career, and <a href=#>romance with Humphrey Bogart</a>. Twenty-six years later, she released an expanded edition of the book now called By Myself and Then Some that invited fans to catch up with her once again. The newly added 80 pages are pure unbridled Bacall, who was 81 at the time of release. She ruminates on aging in Hollywood, shares her haunting memories of being in New York City on 9/11, and mourns the loss of famous friends like Katharine Hepburn. You’ll get your money’s worth and then some.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: By Myself and Then Some on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">All About Me!: My Remarkable Life in Show Business, Mel Brooks (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AllAboutMe.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2021, at the age of 95, legendary comedic auteur <a href=#>Mel Brooks</a> released his first autobiography, All About Me!, which covers his celebrated 70 years and counting career in show business. Across 480 pages, he puts his delightful sense of humor on full display, telling laugh-out-loud stories about being a teenage comedian in the Catskills, working as a writer for volatile funny guy Sid Caesar, and the making of the legendary flatulence scene in <a href=#>Blazing Saddles</a>. But comedy wasn’t the great love of his life, as All About Me! makes abundantly clear. It was <a href=#>his late wife, Anne Bancroft</a>, who passed away in 2005 of uterine cancer at the age of 73. In many ways this book is a loving salute to her and her ability to bring the best out of Brooks onscreen and off.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: All About Me! on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Meaning of Mariah Carey, Mariah Carey (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MariahCarey.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With <a href=#>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</a>, the titular pop icon with a five-octave vocal range reflects on her life and career so far. Mariah Carey, with help from journalist Michaela Angela Davis, doesn’t shy away from writing about her difficult childhood, tempestuous first marriage to music executive Tommy Mottola, and <a href=#>her mental health struggles</a>. But it isn’t all doom and gloom; she also offers unguarded insight into her short-lived romance with <a href=#>Derek Jeter</a>, <a href=#>her love of Christmas</a>, and her beef with Jennifer Lopez.

(Chaplin, who long <a href=#>denied having any Communist affiliations</a>, stepped foot in the States only once before his 1977 death to pick up <a href=#>an honorary Oscar.</a>) Perhaps that’s why his autobiography doesn’t pull any punches about his impoverished childhood, successful silent film career, and self-exile. (He does not, however, write about his <a href=#>romances with underaged women</a>.) At this point in his life, Chaplin was a man with nothing to lose.

While it’s definitely worth a read, it’s his cheeky second book, 2018’s Baggage, that taps into what has made Cumming such a beloved show business staple. Full of juicy gossip, dirty puns, and plenty of exclamation points, Baggage picks up in 1994 amid his failing marriage to fellow actor Hilary Lyon. The dissolution of that relationship leads the then up-and-coming actor on a journey toward self-discovery. With humor and panache, Cumming divulges his juiciest tales including being scolded by a drunken Gore Vidal, using ecstasy the night he won the Tony for Cabaret, and enduring the dysfunctional X2 film set led by the now-disgraced director <a href=#>Bryan Singer</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Baggage on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Finding Me, Viola Davis (2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ViolaDavis.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Allow <a href=#>Viola Davis</a> to reintroduce herself with her radically honest debut memoir. <a href=#>Finding Me</a> delves into Davis’ journey to become the unflappable person and performer she is today. She details the constant bullying she endured from mostly white classmates growing up and how that helped her succeed at Juilliard, where she fought to empower Black students who felt stifled by the legendary school’s curriculum. It seems only fitting that the audiobook of Finding Me won Davis a Grammy, helping her become one of only 19 people to clinch Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards.

That is, until Chronicle: Volume One, his eye-opening 2004 memoir in which he rambles on (in a good way) about growing up in Minnesota, finding folk music in Greenwich Village, and <a href=#>going electric</a> at the Newport Folk Festival. As he traces his journey from complete unknown to voice of a generation (a label he’s not so fond of), he also introduces fans to wild characters and scenes that seem straight out of one of his songs. Knowing Dylan’s penchant for <a href=#>embellishing the truth</a> of his own biography, one may wonder if what they read in Chronicles is true. Our advice: don’t think twice, it’s all right if he fudges the facts when the results are this entertaining.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Chronicles on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Wishful Drinking, Carrie Fisher (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CarrieFisher.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If my life wasn’t funny it would just be true,” <a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a> writes in her first memoir, Wishful Drinking. “And that is unacceptable.” It’s only fitting then that this book, adapted from Fisher’s 2006 one-woman show of the same name, takes a self-deprecating look at the Star Wars actor’s stranger-than-fiction existence as the daughter of two eccentric Hollywood stars, Singin’ in the Rain actor Debbie Reynolds and crooner (and one-time husband of Elizabeth Taylor) Eddie Fisher.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Wishful Drinking on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">My Life So Far, Jane Fonda (2005)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JaneFonda.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s safe to say <a href=#>Jane Fonda</a> has lived a lot of life since the 2005 release of her memoir, <a href=#>My Life So Far</a>. (Watch the 2018 HBO documentary <a href=#>Jane Fonda in Five Acts</a> to fill in the nearly 20 year gap.) But that’s what makes this book, her first, so captivating; it is not a complete look at the award-winning actor and activist’s existence. Nor, as the title implies, was it intended to be. Back in 2005, Fonda, then nearing 60, felt that she had been defined by her family name, her film roles, and her relationships with powerful men like media mogul Ted Turner, activist and politician <a href=#>Tom Hayden</a>, and Barbarella director Roger Vadim. In her memoir, she takes back the narrative and explores the traumas of her past. Part Hollywood tell-all, part self-help book, My Life So Far offers a poignant look at how Fonda found her authentic self.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: My Life So Far on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, Dave Grohl (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Storyteller.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Storyteller is a portrait of an aging artist as a young man. Throughout the book, Dave Grohl recalls the musical memories of his past, returning to his early days as a suburban Virginia kid learning to play the drums like Led Zeppelin’s John Bonham before quitting high school to join the D.C. hardcore band Scream. The Foo Fighter writes of the ebbs and flows that came with being the drummer for one of the biggest rock bands of all time, <a href=#>Nirvana</a>, and doesn’t hold back when speaking of the pain he felt—and still feels—after the loss of <a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a>.

It’s what makes the book, the basis for the 1972 film of the same name starring Diana Ross, such a heartbreaking self-portrait of a legendary musician gone too soon. Released three years before her death at the age of 44, Lady Sings the Blues offers a candid look at the jazz singer’s chaotic life and career, offering sobering accounts of her teenage years working as a call girl, <a href=#>struggles with heroin addiction</a>, time spent in jail, and the racism she faced as a Black performer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Lady Sings the Blues on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Me, Elton John (2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EltonJohn.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Elton John</a>’s memoir, Me, is his deliciously dishy account of how a shy English schoolboy named Reginald Dwight became the bedazzled and bespectacled Captain Fantastic. John has fun revisiting his humble beginnings, recalling his ‘70s heyday, and reveling in celebrity gossip. (Bob Dylan is apparently terrible at charades—who knew?) But the majority of John’s mockery is aimed at himself. (Case in point: he spends a lot of time trying to explain his <a href=#>much-talked about hair</a>.) His honesty and humility about his own ups (his coming out, his advocacy) and downs (drug addiction, tragic loss of friends Princess Diana and Gianni Versace) make this a <a href=#>charming swan song</a> by a glitter rock icon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Me on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Thursday’s Child, Eartha Kitt (1956)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EarthaKitt.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Whether you know <a href=#>Eartha Kitt</a> as the <a href=#>Catwoman to Adam West’s Batman</a> or <a href=#>Harriet the Spy’s reclusive neighbor</a>, her first of three memoirs, 1956’s Thursday’s Child, offers a look at the first 30 years of her incredible life and career. (Fun fact: Kitt’s book also inspired the 1999 <a href=#>David Bowie song</a> of the same name.) Born in 1927, Kitt, whose real name was Eartha Mae Keith, grew up poor in the Deep South with her young mom, who was of Cherokee and African descent. When her mom’s boyfriend refused to accept Kitt for the color of her skin, she was adopted by an aunt who lived in New York City. It’s there that Kitt joined a dance troupe led by <a href=#>Katherine Dunham</a>, the “queen mother of Black dance,” and traveled the world before making her way to Hollywood. Kitt doesn’t gloss over the racism and sexism she faced during her early years as an actress and singer, which makes her rise to stardom all the more compelling. It also helps that Kitt has a knack for storytelling; Thursday’s Child reads like a riveting novel you don’t want to put down rather than a paint by numbers autobiography.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Thursday’s Child on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Spike Lee: Best Seat in the House: A Basketball Memoir, Spike Lee (1997)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SpikeLee.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For more than three decades, <a href=#>Spike Lee</a> has been cheering on his beloved New York Knicks from a courtside seat at Madison Square Garden. (He has also stirred up a bit of controversy from that same spot; most notably, his feud with former Indiana Pacer <a href=#>Reggie Miller</a>.) His passion for the sport is on full display in his first memoir, Best Seat in the House, in which the legendary Brooklyn director tells the story of his life through the lens of basketball fandom. With help from late Sports Illustrated journalist <a href=#>Ralph Wiley</a>, he recounts how watching his long struggling hometown franchise helped him grieve his mother, who died when he was in college, and survive the frustrating shoot of his 1992 film <a href=#>Malcolm X</a>.

Across 263 pages, Mock lays her soul bare, sharing the heartbreak and confusion she felt throughout her childhood being identified as a boy when she knew she was not.

For all that Mock was forced to endure, her memoir is anything but despairing. She writes lovingly of the women who supported her throughout her transition, whether it be by helping her pick out the right clothes or loving her when she didn’t know how to love herself.

For Zauner, who is half-Korean and half-white, losing her mom sent her searching for “evidence that the Korean half of my identity didn’t die when they did.” Over the course of 256 pages, the leader of the indie pop band <a href=#>Japanese Breakfast</a> writes of the foods they both loved: <a href=#>miyeok-guk</a>, a comforting non-spicy seaweed soup often served to new mothers, or <a href=#>sannakji</a>, a controversial live octopus dish. Using her palate and her favorite food memories, she looks to reconcile her complicated relationship with her mom, whose constant nagging she comes to realize was her love language.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Crying in H Mart on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlthHR9jpucrKxdmLKtscGroK2xXaKyrrvIq6po</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1207812-top-clove-benefits-men-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top clove benefits for men: why should they consume it?">&larr;
