After all, there’s no&nbsp;reason why we&nbsp;should limit our options to&nbsp;just white when getting married. Especially nowadays when the <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> industry has come up&nbsp;with so&nbsp;many cool and edgy options to&nbsp;shake things up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit on&nbsp;that special day. Clearly, this is&nbsp;what some of&nbsp;the most famous celebrities of&nbsp;our time (along with many other brides) decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for. And it’s no&nbsp;wonder&nbsp;— celebrities are always the avant-garde when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;creating amazing new styles and events.</p><p>That being said, <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;share some of&nbsp;the coolest, edgiest, and trendiest <a href=# title="wedding dresses" data-link=tag>wedding dresses</a> that celebrities wore as&nbsp;they said, “I&nbsp;do.” And who knows, you might end up&nbsp;ditching the white dress of&nbsp;your dreams after finding some inspiration for your own wedding here.</p><p><h2>1. Emma Thompson</h2></p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;unusual wedding dresses, <a href=#>Emma Thompson</a>’s seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the list. Thompson <a href=#>married</a> fellow-actor Kenneth Branagh in&nbsp;1989. For that occasion, she left behind the typical white wedding dress and wore a&nbsp;short, multicolored one with a&nbsp;somewhat peculiar hat.</p><p>While their relationship didn’t ultimately pass the test of&nbsp;time, they were considered a&nbsp;golden couple of&nbsp;English cinema in&nbsp;the early ’90s and they left&nbsp;us with this rare but original wedding dress jewel.</p><p><h2>2. Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II</h2></p><p>When the then-Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip, Europe was not really the place to&nbsp;be. World War II&nbsp;had just ended and economic problems were still the order of&nbsp;the day. But royal weddings are always a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;celebration, not just for the Royal Family, but also for the rest of&nbsp;the world. And as&nbsp;you can imagine, the future <a href=#>Queen</a>’s wedding was no&nbsp;exception.</p><p>She <a href=#>paid for her dress</a> with clothing ration coupons, and on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, admirers sent her their own coupons by&nbsp;mail so&nbsp;that the princess could have her dream wedding garment. Even though these were returned since it&nbsp;was illegal to&nbsp;accept these offerings, she wore an&nbsp;ivory-colored satin dress embroidered with 10,000 pearls and 4-meters of&nbsp;silk tulle.</p><p><h2>3. Dita Von Teese</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>actress</a> and model married rock singer <a href=#>Marilyn Manson</a> in&nbsp;2005, and what we&nbsp;least expect from them was traditional attire on&nbsp;their wedding day. The “Queen of&nbsp;Burlesque” wore<a href=#> a&nbsp;purple dress</a> with a&nbsp;corset and a&nbsp;wide skirt along with a&nbsp;hat, faithfully reflecting the artistic trend that made her so&nbsp;famous.</p><p><h2>4. Priscilla Presley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fb/c41/823e1352889b70befd679d63ac.jpg><p>When <a href=#>Priscilla</a> married <a href=# title="the King" data-link=tag>the King</a> of&nbsp;Rock ’n’ Roll, <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>, she wore a&nbsp;fairly simple <a href=#>dress</a> but one that was perfect for the occasion. It&nbsp;went perfectly with their intimate, cozy, romantic ceremony. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;white dress with long lace sleeves and inlaid stones. But finding it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;real challenge. She wanted to&nbsp;remain anonymous when shopping, so&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;stores wearing wigs and used fake names all the time.</p><p>The wedding was far from the large, luxurious event that music stars typically hold. Still, the Presleys soon became one of&nbsp;the most iconic and remembered couples of&nbsp;all time.</p><p><h2>5. Solange Knowles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d8/222/4086685446bd0f0a3c8a0ad942.jpg><p>Beyoncé’s sister and fellow singer got <a href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;2014. Her <a href=#>outfits</a> were simple, but that’s exactly what made them beautiful and elegant. She arrived at&nbsp;the ceremony wearing a&nbsp;very stylish jumpsuit that featured a&nbsp;cape and then switched into a&nbsp;Kenzo dress. But her modern dress was not the only thing that broke the traditional bride stereotype. Her means of&nbsp;transportation was something unheard&nbsp;of. Forget about limousines or&nbsp;carriages: the bride arrived at&nbsp;her reception on&nbsp;her <a href=#>bike</a>!</p><p><h2>6. Yoko Ono</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39c/65e/9d5ba959199fb6e9e76755462b.jpg><p><a href=#>Yoko Ono</a>’s <a href=#>wedding</a> with the lead singer of&nbsp;the Beatles lasted barely 10&nbsp;minutes. They got married at&nbsp;the British Consulate in&nbsp;Gibraltar. The couple’s austerity was also reflected in&nbsp;their attire: she wore a&nbsp;miniskirt and a&nbsp;top, which she paired with sunglasses, a&nbsp;hat, long socks, and tennis shoes.</p><p>But that’s not the only thing that made this wedding special. While many couples would travel to&nbsp;the Bahamas for their honeymoon, John and Yoko settled down in&nbsp;the Hilton Hotel in&nbsp;Amsterdam. Far from visiting the city and doing tourist activities like any other newlywed couple, they made the famous demonstration for peace, <a href=#>Bed-Ins for Peace</a>, in&nbsp;which they spent 7&nbsp;days in&nbsp;bed.</p><p>While their marriage was supposed to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;secret, thanks to&nbsp;the demonstration, then they became the most famous couple in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>7. Kaley Cuoco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fba/6ba/32a4315d78b8be0a055acc533e.jpg><p>At&nbsp;her first wedding, the Big Bang Theory <a href=#>star</a> cut loose from the tradition of&nbsp;the white wedding <a href=#>dress</a> as&nbsp;well: she impressed everyone with an&nbsp;all-pink gown. Unfortunately, her marriage did not endure the test of&nbsp;time, but hey, love came knocking at&nbsp;her door once again and she said, “I&nbsp;do!”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;much more mature setting, Kuoko wore a&nbsp;beautiful white lace dress paired with a&nbsp;lace cape as&nbsp;well. Could it&nbsp;be&nbsp;that this time she refused to&nbsp;go&nbsp;off the beaten path because she thought it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad omen?</p><p><h2>8. Camilla, Duchess of&nbsp;Cornwall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a4/1d1/6ee7bb53a4b9f13134073ee290.jpg><p>Far from being a&nbsp;grand royal <a href=#>wedding</a>, worthy of&nbsp;2&nbsp;future monarchs, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles’ marriage was far more laid-back, and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, more casual than the heir’s first wedding. A&nbsp;civil union and a&nbsp;blessing in&nbsp;St. George’s Chapel followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;reception sufficed for the couple to&nbsp;celebrate their love for each other.</p><p>In&nbsp;accordance with the event’s tone, Camilla was not wearing a&nbsp;long white wedding <a href=#>dress</a>, but rather, opted for a&nbsp;chiffon and silk dress with a&nbsp;coat of&nbsp;the same fabric. Charles never would see his bride enter the church and walk down the aisle dressed in&nbsp;white. But in&nbsp;the end, all that matters is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;finally got what he&nbsp;had been waiting for: marry the woman <a href=#>he&nbsp;truly loved</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Shirley Temple</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>actress</a><a href=#>’s</a> first marriage took place when she was merely 17&nbsp;years old. Because she had been working since she was a&nbsp;child, the people of&nbsp;her country, and the whole world, had seen her grow up&nbsp;on-screen. Clearly, no&nbsp;one wanted to&nbsp;miss this great moment in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;the young film prodigy. She surprised everyone with a&nbsp;short-sleeved satin <a href=#>dress</a>, which was very fashionable at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>10. Gwen Stefani</h2></p><p>While <a href=#>Stefani</a> was enjoying her golden hour as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;<a href=#>No&nbsp;Doubt</a>, she got married and wore a&nbsp;<a href=#>dress</a> that was as&nbsp;funky as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was unique. Stefani wore a&nbsp;voluminous Christian Dior dress with <a href=# title=pink data-link=tag>pink</a> degradé at&nbsp;the bottom and a&nbsp;long veil. It&nbsp;was very punk but refined, perfect for such an&nbsp;original and upbeat girl like her.</p><p><h2>11. Miley Cyrus</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;late 2018, the former Disney girl surprised the entire world when she married Australian actor Liam Hemsworth. The couple got married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret ceremony with their closest family and friends. Their attire was as&nbsp;relaxed, romantic, and simple as&nbsp;the event itself. <a href=#>Cyrus</a> wore an&nbsp;elegant ivory silk satin <a href=#>dress</a>, but somehow, we&nbsp;were left with the feeling that if&nbsp;they’d actually gone for a&nbsp;big wedding, they might have impressed&nbsp;us with something a&nbsp;little more eccentric and wild, something that we&nbsp;could clearly recognize as&nbsp;<a href=# title=Cyrus data-link=tag>Cyrus</a>’ signature look.</p><p><h2>12. Kandi Burruss</h2></p><p>When the <a href=#>singer and cast member</a> of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of&nbsp;Atlanta said she was about to&nbsp;get married, she meant&nbsp;it. Just as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she were a&nbsp;participant in&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality show, Burruss <a href=#>documented</a> the entire event on&nbsp;camera in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special called Kandi’s Wedding and revealed everything that went into the preparations for the big day.</p><p>And, of&nbsp;course, her <a href=#>dress</a> was as&nbsp;stunning as&nbsp;the event itself. It&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;stones and feathers, had a&nbsp;3-meter long train, and was a&nbsp;Reco Chapple. Just in&nbsp;case you were wondering, it’s estimated that the entire dress cost no&nbsp;less than $20,000. I&nbsp;guess we’ll all have to&nbsp;keep on&nbsp;saving for a&nbsp;while if&nbsp;we&nbsp;want a&nbsp;dress like that!</p><p><h2>13. Allison Pill</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;there’s one thing these brides have taught&nbsp;us, it’s that the color of&nbsp;your dress can be&nbsp;your favorite color. No&nbsp;need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for white if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;— just ask actress <a href=#>Alison Pill</a>. For her <a href=#>wedding</a>, the Canadian actress wore a&nbsp;yellow <a href=# title=vintage data-link=tag>vintage</a> dress that perfectly matched her beautiful golden curls.</p><p>If&nbsp;you had to&nbsp;pick some exotic attire for a&nbsp;special day, what would you go&nbsp;for? Let&nbsp;us know in&nbsp;the comments or&nbsp;share pictures of&nbsp;yourself if&nbsp;you’ve already done this before!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH50edSnoKqtlWKur7CMqJ2fmpWWwW7DxJ2boqaXYrGzsdKsnKxlpJ2utXnWnqmeZaekv695wbJknJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxlZ26Fen%2BYaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1420403-atticus-shaffers-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-condition-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Atticus Shaffer's bio: age, height, net worth, girlfriend, condition">&larr;
