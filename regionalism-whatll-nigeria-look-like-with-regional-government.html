The Mid-Western region was later carved out of the Western region in 1963.</p><p>This model was sustained until 1966, when Nigeria’s first military Head of State, <strong>General Aguiyi Ironsi</strong>, promulgated the ‘unification decree’ following the killing of national political figures by rebellious soldiers.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ac5791ff-c397-46dc-978f-e982cdced97a data-caption="Late Major General Johnson Aguiyi Ironsi."><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/MsIktkpTURBXy82NDQ3ZTQ1NDRhODA0NjBkOGM3ZTQxMWIyMmYwODJlOC5wbmeRlQLNAifNATXCww></span><p>The killing marked <a href=# id=22769db4-5146-4725-b629-c26b7cf6b9e9 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>the first coup in Nigeria</a> and the beginning of military interruptions in the country’s political system.</p><p>In a bid to eliminate tribal loyalty and sectional interests encouraged by regionalism, Ironsi introduced a unitary system of government aimed at fostering unity and national cohesion.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Notwithstanding the tribalism entrenched in the model, each of the regions recorded significant developments in different areas as it encouraged healthy competition among the regions governed by the three major tribes: the Yorubas, Hausas, and Igbos.</p><p>The development of these regions championed by their political leaders was largely predicated on an agrarian economy.</p><p>The Western region under the leadership of <strong>Chief Obafemi Awolowo</strong> had cocoa as its economic mainstay, while the development of the Northern region supervised by <strong>Sir Ahmadu Bello</strong> relied on groundnut, cotton, and other agricultural produce.</p><p>The economy of the Eastern region under the leadership of <strong>Michael Okpara</strong> was hinged on the production of palm and cassava while the Mid-Western region had a rubber industry situated in Sapele.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-1f6e8c8a-93e8-43ce-b4c5-4575154056b2 data-caption="Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Chief Michael Okpara and Sir Ahmadu Bello."><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/5PBktkpTURBXy9kZDBjYTM5MjQ4NDdmZTFiNzY5OTRmMzdiMGE5ZWY5NS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAcfCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Many Nigerians who experienced regionalism as a system of government believe the country was better off under this arrangement.</p><p>In a recent interview with <strong>ThisDay</strong>, a former national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), <strong>Senator Victor Umeh</strong>, said the system allowed the regions to pursue development aggressively without any problem.</p><p>“All these regions were developing at their own pace with the resources available to them. They were contributing royalties to the federal government. You could see that the speed of development was quite high,” he submitted.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>The government structure</h3></p><p>It is imperative to note that Nigeria practised a hybrid of regional government and parliamentary system of government between 1960 and 1963.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This political setup had <strong>Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe</strong> as the president who played a ceremonial role and <strong>Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa</strong> as the Prime Minister, who acted as the head of government.</p><p>Unlike the presidential system which vests so much power in the hands of the president, the real power in the parliamentary system rests in the hands of the prime minister.</p><p>In this political arrangement, members of the executive are also members of parliament and it is the political party with the highest number of seats in the parliament that produces the prime minister and forms the cabinet.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-43e2ac0c-85c4-4543-afde-840bf8de405e data-caption="Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe and Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa."><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Bf2ktkpTURBXy8zODQzNmM4YTc5NDJiY2ZiOGFmMWZlNzBlMDkzYzQzMi5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAcfCww></span><p>Should Nigeria revert to a regional system of government as practised in the early 1960s, the current arrangement would collapse to accommodate a prime minister and premiers who would act as head of government at the regional level.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And since a parliamentary system allows both unicameral and bicameral legislative setup, the current National Assembly may be retained or modified to align with the new model.</p><p>Also, the system may provide proponents of a unilateral lawmaking body with more impetus to drive home their demand.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>What will Nigeria look like if the regional government is re-adopted?</h3></p><p>The scrapping of regionalism gave birth to systems of government that saw development through <a href=# id=4b40c871-1b8f-4154-ad2b-1af63fd62c7c data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>the creation of states</a> from the regions.</p><p>Currently, Nigeria is partitioned into six main regions namely, South West, South East, South South, North West, North East, and North Central.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Each of the regions has six states except North West and South East which have seven and five states respectively.</p><p>Returning to a regional system of government implies that the current regions will take over the control of the resources in their states while the Federal Government receives royalties from them.</p><p>It will also imply that the central or federal government will not interfere in the affairs of the regional governments.</p><p>Essentially, a return to regionalism will address three fundamental issues on which the clamour for restructuring is often predicated — resource control, security, and energy.</p><p><strong>Resource Control: </strong>As stated earlier, if the speculation becomes a reality, it is expected to reconfigure Nigeria in a way that the South-South region will have power and control over its oil resources. The same applies to other regions and their mineral resources deposits.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> As things stand, the Federal Government has exclusive power over the police force, the Nigerian Army, and other security forces. This arrangement makes things difficult for governors to control troops to fight militants, bandits, kidnappers, terrorists, and cultists in their states.</p><p>However, a re-adoption of regionalism will allow each region to tackle insecurity challenges as they deem fit without necessarily requesting the support of the Federal Government.</p><p>On the contrary, it does not mean the police force, the army, the navy, and the air force will be thrown out. They will still be under the control of the Federal Government to protect the sovereignty of the country while state security outfits co-exist with them.</p><p><strong>Energy: </strong>This is one of the banes of Nigeria under the exclusive control of the Federal Government.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Even though the constitution allows both federal and state governments to legislate on energy, it did not grant state governments the power to generate, transmit, and distribute energy until June 2023, when <a href=# id=f4ad8e6d-15b1-40af-a297-592d76f276db data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>President Tinubu signed the electricity bill</a>, repealing the Electricity and Power Sector Reform Act of 2005.</p><p>With this in place, a major problem has been solved for a regional system of government if it ever happens.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-47>Will Tinubu return Nigeria to regionalism?</h3></p><p>It is too early to call but the president seems to be preparing the ground for a re-adoption of a system of government many experts have described as the silver bullet to most of the challenges facing the country.</p><p>Assenting the electricity bill and a return to the old national anthem, a relic of the regional system suggest the president, who came to power promising <a href=# id=3513404e-c70b-4f49-aad3-a0b085951c17 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>true federalism</a>, may return the country to the system political commentators of his generation nostalgically crave.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyzscaipqeZnJ7ArnnWoZitpJxiu6qzxKugmmWcpLysecuiop5lp57BqXnRnp6ip56WuW6zzq%2Bcq6admru1e8agsaefk2o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rehabilitation-thermique-de-logements-sociaux-en-champagne-ardenne-2012.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rhabilitation thermique de logements sociaux en Champagne-Ardenne">&larr;
