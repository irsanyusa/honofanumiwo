That’s exactly what happened to&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grandma</a>, who just wanted to&nbsp;help her granddaughter but ended stirring up&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole mess in&nbsp;the family.</p><p><h2>She just wanted to&nbsp;help her granddaughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d2/405/2098fb5ccfb640bc402df59956.jpg><p>“This is&nbsp;about my&nbsp;granddaughter, Lindsey. Lindsey (15) has it&nbsp;rough being a&nbsp;middle child, and she looks different from her siblings. I&nbsp;was truly confused about how she had blond, curly hair while the rest of&nbsp;the family had dark hair. I&nbsp;thought genetics was weird, and&nbsp;I love her.</p><p>The issue came up&nbsp;when Lindsey told me&nbsp;her parents banned her from getting an&nbsp;ancestry test. I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;son and DIL that there was something fishy around her birth that she needed to&nbsp;know. They denied it&nbsp;and told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave it&nbsp;alone. Lindsey is&nbsp;now in&nbsp;high school, and she went to&nbsp;her biology teacher. To&nbsp;put it&nbsp;bluntly, the teacher said it&nbsp;was odd for her to&nbsp;have some traits.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9e/b58/9d3f475fa3a00f4e9ae1ee7494.jpg><p>“She came to&nbsp;me&nbsp;distressed, asking me&nbsp;to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;DNA test since she needed to&nbsp;know. Long story short, she is&nbsp;not her mother’s kid. My&nbsp;son got someone else pregnant, and her biological mom gave her&nbsp;up.</p><p>This has blown up&nbsp;the family, and while Lindsey is&nbsp;pissed about being lied&nbsp;to, I&nbsp;am getting a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;heat for getting her a&nbsp;DNA test. Now they won’t talk to&nbsp;me, which is&nbsp;making Lindsey even more mad at&nbsp;them.”</p><p><h2>What Redditors had to&nbsp;say about&nbsp;it.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the meantime, her <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> post attracted a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;interest, flooded with comments that the woman struggled to&nbsp;keep pace with. Reddit ignited with discussions about Lindsey’s family saga. Users shared varied opinions, expressing astonishment and <a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a> for Lindsey’s situation. The revelation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hidden family secret sparked debates on&nbsp;trust, transparency, and the consequences of&nbsp;keeping such information concealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71f/c75/c12fd351b3bd8f6456558f0862.jpg><ul><li>Your son and his wife lied to&nbsp;her until she is&nbsp;15&nbsp;about something so&nbsp;important, and trying to&nbsp;keep lying to&nbsp;her even after she obviously started to&nbsp;question things. There are medical reasons a&nbsp;person might need to&nbsp;know what their genetics are or&nbsp;are not, and if&nbsp;you hadn’t helped her, she would have found out some other way. At&nbsp;least this way, she knows she has one friend and ally who will be&nbsp;honest with her. Take care of&nbsp;each other during this difficult time. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Shake_Speare423&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>It’s not the end of&nbsp;the world if&nbsp;they don’t. My&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;adopted and has never found her biological father. We&nbsp;have no&nbsp;medical history on&nbsp;that end of&nbsp;the family. When I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;kid<i>,</i> I&nbsp;just did extra genetic testing to&nbsp;make sure everything would be&nbsp;fine. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>morbid_n_creepifying&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>People have a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;know their genetic heritage. You put her safety and comfort ahead of&nbsp;your son’s preferences. My&nbsp;grandparents helped my&nbsp;parents lie to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;adoption, and not only have&nbsp;I never forgiven any of&nbsp;them, but I’m still in&nbsp;therapy over all of&nbsp;it.<br>To&nbsp;answer some of&nbsp;the repeated nonsense here, parental rights do&nbsp;not have greater value than a&nbsp;child’s right to&nbsp;access comprehensive medical care, and hiding an&nbsp;adoption does precisely that. Maybe some things, like a&nbsp;child staying healthy, should matter more than a&nbsp;parent’s right to&nbsp;lie, gaslight, and <a href=# title=manipulate data-link=tag>manipulate</a> their child as&nbsp;they see fit. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>RemembrancerLirael&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f2/d73/8aebf65387806b2c5032061ac1.jpg><ul><li>How do&nbsp;you not know that your granddaughter’s mom is&nbsp;not her biological mom?

The only part she didn’t know was which parent was hers biologically. Lindsey isn’t dumb. She was going to&nbsp;find out, or&nbsp;she was going to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;get lied to&nbsp;for three more years. Your son is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;deflect blame onto you.

They had every opportunity to&nbsp;handle this in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mature and sensible way but decided that would be&nbsp;too hard and awkward to&nbsp;deal with and stuck their heads in&nbsp;the sand.<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mizu005&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>This girl has felt a&nbsp;disconnect from her family, and her parents kept ignoring her pleas. They shut down any conversation, refusing to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;her. I&nbsp;assume they did so&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect your son from his cheating. They did it&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect their image. However, they did this at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;their daughter.<br>You did overstep. You did go&nbsp;against your granddaughter’s parents, but you did so&nbsp;because of&nbsp;your granddaughter.
