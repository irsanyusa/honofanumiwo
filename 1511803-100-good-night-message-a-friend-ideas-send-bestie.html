I wish you a very charming and peaceful rest.</li><li>I can never be too busy to forget to wish my best bud a good evening. Do have an excellent rest.</li><li>Stop thinking about what happened today.

Have a good evening, bud.</li><li>You are the sweetest person that I know! May you feel at ease tonight, knowing how great you are!</li><li>When I say good evening to special people like you, it is an all-in-one wish: sweet dreams, I miss you and see you soon.</li><li>I want you to enjoy this evening and let your mind rest. Have a great night, buddy.</li><li>It's almost insane that you made me your bestie out of 7 billion people. Every evening before I sleep, I say a prayer for your life.</li><li>My sweet friend, you have worked so hard throughout the day, and now you deserve a solid sleep! Sleep well.</li><li>As you travel to the dream world, think of me, so I can appear in your dreams and make you laugh like I always do. Remember that it's always darkest before dawn. Good evening.</li><li>Buddy, may you drift off surrounded by thoughts of how much you mean to me.</li><li>I could have sent you a funny joke, an inspirational quote, or a sweet message. But I have chosen to remind you that we are besties simply. Sweet dreams!</li><li>The simplest solution to wind down the day is to relax and think about all the things you are grateful for. Your company has been a true blessing in my life. I hope you rest well, dear.</li><li>There's only one today, between a million yesterday and a million tomorrow. And I would never let it pass without telling you I'm thinking of you. Rest well.</li><li>God has given us the night to relieve stress, sadness, and tiredness. So utilize the time. Go rest and relax.</li><li>They say that too much of everything is bad. However, too much of your friendship isn't. Have a great evening, my dear.</li><li>Even if I had a bad start with my day, spending it with you magically turns it into a bright day.
