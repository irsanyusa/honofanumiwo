The deadline for appeals is on Thursday.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>With his wife, Candice, crying as she watched from the back of the room, Warner stonewalled requests for more details about the incident and his relationship with the team.</p><p>"I am here today to accept my responsibility for my part and my involvement for what happened in Cape Town," Warner said, using a formulation he repeated several times.</p><p>"It's inexcusable, I am deeply sorry. I will do everything I can to earn back the respect of the Australian public."</p><p>Warner later took to social media to say: "I know there are unanswered questions and lots of them. I completely understand. In time I will do my best to answer them all. But there is a formal CA process to follow."</p><p>'Gentleman's game'</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Warner, who has played 74 Tests since his debut in 2011, has been described as the Australia's "attack dog". He was also banned in 2013 after punching England's Joe Root in a bar.</p><p>"In the coming weeks and months I am going to look at what has happened and who I am as a man," he said.</p><p>"To be honest, I am not sure right now how I will do this, I will seek out advice and expertise to make serious changes."</p><p>The fallout from the crisis has seen Warner dumped by sponsors ASICS and LG, while Cricket Australia has been dropped by its top sponsor, fund manager Magellan.</p><p>Along with Smith, Warner has also been ejected from this year's Indian Premier League, losing contracts worth nearly US$2 million each.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In Johannesburg, Paine took the unusual step of arranging a pre-match handshake between the teams as he led Australia out for the fourth and final Test of their ill-fated tour.</p><p>"Cricket's a gentlemanâ€™s game. I spoke to our players about bringing it (the handshake) in," said Paine, adding: "I think it's just a good show of sportsmanship and respect."</p><p>South Africa, who lead the series 2-1, were 313 for six at stumps on day one after batting first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXylrdWim2avkae7pr6MrZyaqpaquW6v0aKapJ2kmr9uv8CyqmaskaK9pr7Ip55mq5OWu6Wty2akmrFdqL2muMtmm6innWKzsL6MmqysrKKWuaqtjm2naaNmrb4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./when-the-judges-simon-cowell-audition-with-contestants.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When The Judges, Simon Cowell Audition with Contestants">&larr;
